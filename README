`devsn2mac` (c) 2019 Majenko Technologies.

When using the internal Ethernet peripheral of the PIC32MZ-DA under Linux you
get assigned a random MAC address each time you boot. This is because the
Ethernet peripheral doesn't actually have a MAC address of its own and relies
on software to give it one.

This small program reads the first 6 bytes of the DEVSN registers of the PIC32
and uses that data to generate a MAC address and apply it to the `eth0` network
interface.  The included systemd service unit file should be executed as a "wanted-by"
from the `network.target` to make the alterations to the interface before it is
brought online.

Compiling
=========

Natively
--------

Once you have checked out or downloaded the repo:

    ./bootstrap.sh

This will use `sudo` to install `automake` and `autoconf` if you don't already have
them installed, then run `autoreconf -fi` to generate the configure script.

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

To make it run at startup:

    sudo systemctl enable devsn2mac

Cross-compiling
---------------

Since it can be a bit of a drag compiling and installing on a low-memory system like
a 32MB PIC32MZ-DA cross compilation is fully supported.

Again, run boootstrap:

    ./bootstrap.sh

This time specify a `--host` while configuring, and optionally a location to install:

    ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/staging --host=mipsel-linux-gnu
    make
    (optionally) make install

Manual installation
-------------------

Only two files are required. After compilation copy these files to your PIC32 Linux installation:

    src/devsn2mac         -> /usr/sbin/
    src/devsn2mac.service -> /lib/systemd/system/
